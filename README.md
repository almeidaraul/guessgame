# Guess Game
Party game to have a better life with family during quarantine and then socialize with other people after it's over

Organize teams. In each round, everyone gets a random word and the others have to guess it based on some behavior (mimics, drawings, or whatever else the players decide on). This is an open source, broader alternative to apps like guess up and gartic.

## Plans for Hacktoberfest
I plan on adding support for multiple languages, so that people can help with the translation while participating in the event. Even though the app's functionality is done, it still needs the themes and words for playing. I'll soon add a **contributing** section here for all of this.
